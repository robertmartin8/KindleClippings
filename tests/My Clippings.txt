First, the shocks were highly industry-specific, making it essential to model the economy with a high degree of resolution; second, the shocks affected supply and demand simultaneously; and, third, the shocks were huge and happened really fast. Standard economic models assume equilibrium, which means that supply and demand are always equal. The COVID shocks hit the economy so hard and so quickly that they knocked it far out of equilibrium, making standard models unsuitable. We needed a model that could track the dynamics of the shocks without assuming equilibrium, and we needed to build it very quickly.

We modeled each industry as if it were a single firm; this is a crude approximation, but it was good enough for our purposes. We assumed that each industry began the pandemic with a normal level of inventory. As problems occurred, inventories dropped; if an industry ran low on a critical input, its output dropped. Similarly, if the demand for the industry’s output dropped, or if it didn’t have enough workers because of COVID restrictions, its output would drop. Bear in mind that one industry’s outputs are often another industry’s inputs. Our model tracked the demand shocks as they flowed upstream and the supply shocks as they flowed downstream, colliding with one another and lowering the overall output of the economy.

Last but not least, standard economic theory assumes from the outset that transactions only take place when supply equals demand, a state that is called equilibrium. Complexity-economics models, in contrast, do not necessarily assume equilibrium, but regard it as an emergent property when it happens.

Individual ants are simple creatures with only about 250,000 neurons, so the reasoning power of individual ants is extremely limited. But ants communicate through chemical signals and touch. This gives a colony of ants computational powers that individual ants lack, and through their collective interactions with one another they can do surprisingly sophisticated things. Ant colonies cultivate fungi, raise aphids, fight wars and take slaves. Individual ants can’t do these things. There is no Super Ant directing the colony – the queen is just an egg factory. Instead, these sophisticated collective behaviors emerge from the interactions of many ants.

James and I made households the reference point (like the Sun in a food web) and assigned them a trophic level of zero. In economics, the trophic level of an industry can be thought of as the depth of its supply chain. It measures the number of steps required to make an industry’s product.18  An industry whose only input is labor has a trophic level of 1, because its only input comes from households, which by definition have a trophic level of zero. An industry with inputs from industries other than labor automatically has a trophic level greater than 1. An industry has a high trophic level if the fraction of its inputs from labor are small and if its other inputs have high trophic levels. Service industries tend to have low trophic levels and manufacturing industries tend to have high trophic levels. (Note that the trophic level is essentially the same as what is called an output multiplier in economics,

American agriculture, for example, has a high trophic level, reflecting a high degree of mechanization. The US industry with the highest trophic level is Food, because Agriculture, by far its biggest input, already has a high trophic level. In China, Agriculture is highly labor intensive, giving it a lower trophic level, like that of service industries.

In contrast, for a service-intensive industry whose only input is labor, there are no improvements passed on from the rest of the economy. Any improvements must come from that industry itself – the only way to innovate is to use labor more efficiently.

We showed that the trophic level of a given industry in a given country in 1995 predicts how much its products will have improved fourteen years later. Since there are other factors influencing improvement, the individual predictions are by no means perfect, but they worked extremely well: The average improvement for a given industry in a given country increases proportional to trophic level, as we predicted, and our hypothesis is strongly confirmed with extraordinarily high levels of statistical significance. This helps explain some well-established economic facts, such as why manufacturing industries tend to improve faster than service industries,

Adam Smith argued that specialization makes the economy work better. Our work here shows that specialization also boosts the rate of innovation in the economy. This happens automatically: Each industry in the production network can count on the rest of the economy to improve its inputs and provide it with new technologies that will allow improvements in its own processes.

The Beveridge curve plots the job-vacancy rate against the unemployment rate. As we enter a recession, job vacancies go down and unemployment goes up, and when we recover from a recession, the opposite happens. However, there’s a difference between the trip down and the trip up: At the same level of vacancies, the unemployment rate as we enter a recession is lower than it is as we recover from the recession.

A production function is like a basic recipe with a list of possible variations. In some cases a single input may be absolutely essential, or in other cases substitutions may be allowed. The amount that is produced is not simply the sum of the inputs, but rather depends on the inputs in a more complicated way, which means that the formula relating the inputs to the outputs is a nonlinear function.

When macroeconomists are confronted by nonlinear equations, because they are hard to work with, they often simplify them to make them linear. But because nonlinear dynamics is a prerequisite for endogenous dynamics – that is, motion from within – linearizing the equations makes it impossible for dynamics to emerge. If you want to understand a business cycle, linearizing guarantees that the (model) economy won’t move by itself.

There are several reasons why housing markets are an ideal candidate for agent-based modeling. First, as we learned the hard way in the crisis, housing markets are really important to the entire economy. Second, the way houses are bought and sold makes housing markets hard to model using standard theory (more on this in a moment). In contrast, our agent-based model simply mimics the institutional structures for buying and selling houses in the real world and employs rules of thumb that people actually use to make decisions.

Standard models in economics assume that supply equals demand. This is a reasonable approximation for the stock market on timescales of more than a day, but it is a terrible approximation for housing markets. The supply of houses available for sale at any point in time can be very far from the demand, so that at any given moment there can be a substantial mismatch between the number of houses on the market and the number of people looking for a house.

The second pillar of mainstream economic theory is equilibrium. This idea’s long history stems from the nineteenth-century French mathematical economist Léon Walras, who developed a theory for price formation based on the way stocks used to be traded in the Paris Bourse. In those days an auctioneer would propose a price for a stock and poll the traders in the room to see how many shares were offered to buy or sell at that price. If there was excess demand the auctioneer would raise the price, and if there was excess supply he would lower it. The auctioneer kept polling the traders until demand matched the supply, at which point he would stop and transactions would take place at the final price. By analogy to physics, Walras called the state where supply matches demand equilibrium.

Marshall put the first two pillars together by showing how equilibrium prices and quantities can be derived from utility maximization, building on earlier work by the British logician William Stanley Jevons. Marshall assumed that the price an agent is willing to pay for a good (like an umbrella) is determined by her utility score for that good.

The most widely used model of beliefs is called rational expectations, and was introduced in 1961 by American economist John Muth.2  Under rational expectations, agents use the information available to them to make the best decisions possible based on expectations that are consistent with their underlying model of the world. This is the most common way economists make models for agents who need to take each other into account.

Keynesian-inspired econometric models were challenged by the crisis of high unemployment in the 1970s. In 1974, US unemployment jumped from its previous level of about 4 per cent to almost 8 per cent. This put policymakers under pressure to respond. As the story goes, they tried to exploit something called the Phillips curve to bring down joblessness.5  The Phillips curve refers to the hypothesis that unemployment and inflation are negatively correlated, which up until then had always been the case. If unemployment becomes low, this should push wages higher, which in turn causes inflation. But perhaps causality also runs in the other direction? If prices go up, would manufacturers see this as an optimistic sign and boost production, thus hiring more workers? Policymakers gave it a try,

In the Solow model, the firm pays the household for the labor and capital it needs to produce the good. A key parameter, which you can think of as an adjustable knob, is the savings rate – the fraction of its income that the household saves. The model also has a parameter for population growth (imagine packing the household with many millions of identical occupants). The Solow model predicts that countries that save more become relatively prosperous and countries with rapid population growth become relatively poorer, and shows that the only way the economy can grow in the long run is by making technological progress.

In the early 1960s, David Cass and Tjalling Koopmans each independently modified the Solow model to turn it into a micro-founded DSGE model. They did this by giving the household a utility function and assuming that it is a rational agent whose goal is to adjust its savings rate in order to maximize its utility.7  The household’s utility at any point in time depends on a combination of its current consumption and its expected future consumption. Present consumption is considered more valuable than consumption in the future, which is called discounting. The use of discounted utility was inspired by a 1928 paper by the British mathematician Frank Ramsey, so the resulting model is called the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model, or simply the RCK model.

Complexity economics replaces this with agent-based modeling, which follows a completely different template: Assign each agent a method for making decisions. This can involve heuristics, simple reasoning, search, learning, or a mixture of any of these. When learning algorithms are used, goals may need to be assigned to some agents, but these need not be utility functions. Mimic the institutions, market mechanisms and other economic factors that are actually involved, with as much verisimilitude as necessary (remembering that it can be counterproductive to introduce details that don’t matter).

We assumed that the households in Yuki’s model live in a social network.4  The nodes correspond to households, and a link indicates that they are neighbors, meaning they can observe one another’s behavior. As in the original RCK model, each household saves a fraction of its income and consumes the rest. All the households work for the same firm and receive equal wages. In addition, each household contributes capital to run the business; the households pool their capital and invest it in the firm, and each household receives income based on the firm’s profits in addition to its wages, proportional to its investment.

Our idea was simple: We made up games at random, compiling a list of all possible combinations of players’ possible moves and assigning a random payoff to each player for each combination of moves.

For each randomly constructed game, we repeated the process that Eizo and Yuzuru had developed for rock-paper-scissors: We simulated the learning dynamics of the games using reinforcement learning and recorded what happened. Did the system settle into a fixed-point equilibrium, or were the dynamics chaotic?

The details of our results don’t matter here, but our overall conclusion for competitive games was that, when the reinforcement-learning parameter was set to sensible values, the learning dynamics were overwhelmingly likely to be chaotic. That is, the players never coordinated on an equilibrium; instead, they chased each other around the space of possible strategies in an unpredictable manner.

there were fads. For a while, the two players would fixate on a few possible moves, ignoring all the others. Then they would suddenly abandon those moves, replace them with others, play those for a long period, then shift again. This behavior was intermittent – there were times when there were steady payoffs and other times when payoffs fluctuated a great deal. In financial markets, this is called clustered volatility; in Chapter 11, I will argue that this correspondence is not an accident.

This showed that for competitive games the fraction of chaos increases rapidly as the game gets more complicated. The conclusion was clear: Games converge to a static equilibrium if they are non-competitive or simple; conversely, if they are both competitive and complicated, they are unlikely to converge – instead, their dynamics will be chaotic.

This is formally called the enteric nervous system, but is also nicknamed the gut brain or the second brain. It stretches from the esophagus to the rectum, and has half a billion neurons, five times as many as in the spine and almost as many as the entire nervous system of a cat. It directs the activities of the digestive system while operating almost entirely independently of the brain in your head. If your gut brain ceases to function, you lose the ability to digest food, and, without intravenous feeding, you die.

For around half of the papers, we couldn’t reproduce the results, even when we tested the postulated deviation from efficiency using the same data. The results in another fourth of the papers were correct when we used the same data but failed when we tested the hypothesized method using different time periods or stocks.

At Prediction Company, we built successful models that made good predictions, but the models were black boxes that didn’t explain the mechanisms that caused the inefficiencies we exploited. We had to keep our models secret, which meant they contributed little or no value to society as a whole.

The phrase market efficiency has two senses. The first, ‘allocative efficiency’, means that prices are always set correctly, so effort is allocated appropriately. Stock prices help people decide how to do that: If the price of pork bellies goes up, more farmers will grow hogs. The second, ‘informational efficiency’, means that you can’t increase profits by making better predictions about stock prices. If all investors are rational and operate within perfect markets, everyone’s utility is maximized, and the market is efficient in both the allocational and informational sense.

this depends on strong assumptions that aren’t well-supported in practice. Under more realistic assumptions – for example, when investors are boundedly rational – these two different notions of efficiency are no longer equivalent.

Even though the agents in our model placed random orders, the resulting price movements weren’t random. Rather than making a random walk, the price movements were mean-reverting, meaning that, if the price went up at one point in time, it was more likely to go down at the next point in time.

Jean-Philippe Bouchaud and his collaborators. Jean-Philippe is both a strong mathematician and a brilliant statistical physicist, who also runs a successful hedge fund. He realized that our model showed that order-flow could not be random. If it were, it would create an arbitrage, meaning that a clever trader could make money from the non-random movement in prices. He and his collaborators demonstrated that the assumption of market efficiency implies the square-root law of market impact.

The behavior of the analyst-estimate-based signal was even more striking. No one could have traded this signal until 1984, when a regulatory change made the data it needed available in a timely manner. This signal’s profits were initially very low, but they steadily grew over the next fifteen years. This is exactly the opposite of what the theory of market efficiency would predict! The fact that the market became increasingly inefficient over time is a strong contradiction of the efficient-markets hypothesis.36  How could this be?

During the crash, the use of portfolio insurance triggered an automatic response, creating a feedback loop that couldn’t be stopped, making the problem it was trying to protect investors against much worse. When the market dropped, the computers sold S&P index futures. The resulting market impact pushed the price of the S&P futures index down. Then index arbitrage kicked in. The market impact from this caused the prices of the stocks to drop even further. The combination of portfolio insurance and index arbitrage meant that the more that prices dropped, the more shares were automatically sold, which meant that prices dropped even more, and so on, throwing the market into a death spiral.

William ‘Buz’ Brock of the University of Wisconsin and the Dutch mathematician/economist Cars Hommes found similar results using a much simpler model.12  Their model’s set-up was similar to that of the Santa Fe Artificial Stock Market model; the agents chose between a stock and a bond. But in the Brock-Hommes model, agents were given an explicit choice between a value-investor rule and a few simple technical trading rules. They could monitor the success of each rule and switch to the ones that recently performed best. At different times, different rules tended to dominate. Brock and Hommes observed clustered volatility and fat tails in price returns, just as in the Santa Fe Artificial Stock Market model.

I came to regard finance practitioners as skilled specialists with detailed domain knowledge, who were nonetheless far from rational in the way economists use this term. A perfectly rational agent would be able to exercise all possible strategies at once, whereas real traders are boundedly rational, typically pursuing a single strategy, or a few at most.

There is descent because investors develop their strategies by inheriting knowledge from their mentors, as well as learning from their own prior experience. There is variation because investors tinker with their strategies to improve them. There is selection because strategies compete for profits; successful strategies accumulate wealth and unsuccessful strategies go extinct.

led to a paper titled ‘Market Force, Ecology and Evolution’, which I finished and posted online in 1998. In a nutshell, the basic ideas are that: Financial traders are boundedly rational, so they use specialized strategies. Their strategies can be sorted into groups, like species in biology, even if the boundary between groups can be fuzzy. Financial strategies feed off inefficiencies and interact through prices. Trading has market impact, which changes prices and affects the profits of each strategy. As a result, the wealth of each strategy evolves through time. As the wealth invested in a strategy becomes larger, it has a bigger effect on the market. This causes market inefficiencies to evolve through time. While markets may tend toward an efficient state, the path there is bumpy, the journey is slow and they never really reach their destination. If a destabilizing strategy becomes too dominant, it can unsettle the market and cause it to malfunction. To understand why markets malfunction we need to classify financial strategies, understand how they affect the market and track their evolution through time.

The possible relationships between trading strategies can be classified using biological nomenclature, by applying ‘what-if’ experiments. What if the wealth of strategy A increases? How does that affect the returns of strategy B? Similarly, if the wealth of strategy B increases, how does this affect the returns of strategy A? If both of their returns decrease when the wealth of the other strategy increases, then they have a competitive relationship. If A’s returns go up when B’s wealth goes up, but B’s returns go down when A’s wealth goes up, then they have a predator–prey relationship, in which A is the predator and B is the prey. If both of their returns increase when the other’s wealth goes up, then they have a mutualistic relationship. An important case is when A = B.

To illustrate the effects of overcrowding: One of our main competitors was an investment-management firm called D. E. Shaw, which allied with Bank of America in 1997. An unrelated problem at Bank of America forced D. E. Shaw to temporarily shut down its stat-arb fund. In the nine months or so that D. E. Shaw halted its trading, we made profits at a rate much higher than normal. As soon as they began trading again, this stopped. This was because, in ecological terms, we were competitors, occupying the same niche; our trades were similar to theirs, and we had common market impact, which lowered both of our returns.

Both trend following and margin calls cause inverted demand functions.

As shown in a remarkable paper by the experimental physicist Shoaleh Ghashghaie and collaborators, the fluctuations for both fluid turbulence and finance vary across different scales in precisely the same manner.27  They compared a fluid-turbulence experiment to a finance ‘experiment’. In the fluid-turbulence experiment, they measured fluctuations in wind velocity between two probes at different locations, varying the distance between the probes from millimeters to meters. In the finance experiment, they recorded the fluctuations of the Deutschmark–dollar exchange rate by looking at the change in prices over time-intervals ranging from five minutes to two days. Then they compared the distribution of the sizes of the fluctuations in both cases.

As they went to larger scales, either by putting the velocity probes further apart or by measuring the price changes over a longer time, the distributions became less fat-tailed. By the time the probes were a few meters apart, or the prices were two days apart, the distribution became close to a normal distribution, with thin tails. As the scale changed, the distributions of the velocity fluctuations and price fluctuations changed in exactly the same way.

François performed a careful data analysis, showing that about half of the cost decline for individual technologies is explained by their increase in cumulative production. The other half is explained by the overall trend; the costs of all technologies tended to come down as the war effort ramped up. Thus we can say with some confidence that increasing cumulative production can drive prices down, even if this is not the full story.

Instead of using a representative firm, we model the behavior of tens of thousands of the largest firms, in one-to-one correspondence with real firms.
